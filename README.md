# Infrastructure as code samples for Microsoft Azure

This repository contains the sample source code to the assignment **Infrastructure as Code in Azure Environments â€“ An introduction of Bicep** in IT infrastructre at FOM university.

The source code is subdivided into three stand-alone projects. Each of them creates a resource group in Azure and deploys a ready-to-use virtual machine with its required network configuration.

## 3. Terraform Template

This folder contains the template files for Terraform. In order to use them, the following prerequisites must be met:
- a [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
